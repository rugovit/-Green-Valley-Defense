"Defend your medieval homeland attacked by mysterious flesh eating monsters from the future in this epic strategy game.
Stab, shoot , burn , freeze , poison, call meteor strike on them, do what ever you have to do just don't let them pass!
Build towers to support our ground troops and command them to slow the enemy down enough for our heavy mortar
to give them good pounding..."


This was my first project in Java build back in 2013,  I shere it here in hope someone would find some use of my code or at least  learn from my 
rookie mistakes :D
